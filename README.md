# Network-Analytics-FTP
SMM638 Network Analytics Final Project
# Introduction
This final course project deals with the topics of homophily, closure, and performance. There is consistent evidence that selection and socialization mechanisms – as the vessels of homophily – vastly affect entities' choices such as partner selection, hiring, collaboration, or consumption. What is less clear is how selection and socialization impact an entity's performance by influencing the decision making process.

# Problem to address
##Address the following questions:

- (to what extent) is homophily present in the network dataset at hand?
- then, how does homophily relate to entity's performance?
#Background for the case study
To deliver the project, students may want to rely upon the following concepts and tools:
- theoretical concept of homophily
- homophily-related network mechanisms: selection and socialization
- empirical implementations of the homophily framework
# Dataset
